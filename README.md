# quest-relic-robber
This project is for a Programming for Game Designers course. We were required to make a text adventure game based on a random location, action, and item. 
My random themes I drew were "India," "Fling," and "Rubber Ducky."
"Relic Robber and the Indian Museum" is a text adventure game featuring a thief embarking on a secret mission in India.
This game was made using Quest.
