You don't know any details about your mission yet, aside from the fact that you'll be stealing something from the Indian Museum, the largest and oldest museum in India. <br/>However, word about this mission has been leaked, and you were told by your boss that people will be out there to interfere with your mission. People from other organizations that also evade the law and aren't afriad to use lethal means to achieve their goals. <br/>It's already noon, and you've been waiting for a sign. <br/>Before your departure to India, you were given the code \"Arabica.\" That will lead to your next clue. <br/>For now, you wait patiently.
