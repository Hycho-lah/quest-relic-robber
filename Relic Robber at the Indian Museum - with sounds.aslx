    <description><![CDATA[You've taken a cab and drove your way to the Indian museum. The ride took about 30 minutes. You arrive at the frontyard of the museum and notice the grand museum in front of you. The Indian Museum is the largest and oldest museum in India and has rare collections of antiques, armour and ornaments, fossils, skeletons, mummies, and Mughal paintings. It was founded by the Asiatic Society of Bengal in Kolkata, India, in 1814.<br/>Nonetheless, you're not here to be a tourist. Be on guard from now on. There are security guards patrolling the area. Remember to use the gadgets you've received from the suitcase wisely. Read the notebook for any information you may need. First things first, you need to find a place to put your bomb. That will be useful later in case you are about to get caught. Good Luck!]]></description>
